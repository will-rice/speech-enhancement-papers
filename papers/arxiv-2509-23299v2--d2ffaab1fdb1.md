# MeanFlowSE: One-Step Generative Speech Enhancement via MeanFlow

###### Abstract

Speech enhancement (SE) recovers clean speech from noisy signals and is
vital for applications such as telecommunications and automatic speech
recognition (ASR). While generative approaches achieve strong perceptual
quality, they often rely on multi-step sampling
(diffusion/flow-matching) or large language models, limiting real-time
deployment. To mitigate these constraints, we present MeanFlowSE, a
one-step generative SE framework. It adopts MeanFlow to predict an
average-velocity field for one-step latent refinement and conditions the
model on self-supervised learning (SSL) representations rather than VAE
latents. This design accelerates inference and provides robust
acoustic–semantic guidance during training. In the Interspeech 2020 DNS
Challenge blind test set and simulated test set, MeanFlowSE attains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) level perceptual quality and competitive
intelligibility while significantly lowering both real-time factor (RTF)
and model size compared with recent generative competitors, making it
suitable for practical use. The code will be released upon publication
at [https://github.com/Hello3orld/MeanFlowSE](https://github.com/Hello3orld/MeanFlowSE).

## 1 Introduction

Figure 1: Overview of the proposed MeanFlowSE architecture. The left
side depicts the training pipeline, while the right side illustrates the
one-step inference procedure.

Speech enhancement (SE) aims to remove interference from noisy signals
and is essential for applications such as telecommunications, hearing
aids, and automatic speech recognition (ASR). In recent years, neural
network (NN) based methods have greatly improved the performance of
speech enhancement. NN-based SE methods fall broadly into two paradigms:
discriminative and generative. Discriminative methods aim to directly
estimate clean speech or a corresponding mask from noisy inputs.
Although effective in matched environments, such approaches often
exhibit limited generalizability to unseen acoustic conditions and are
prone to introduce artifacts or distortions, especially in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios \[1, 2, 3\].

Generative methods, in contrast, aim to model the distribution of clean
speech and reconstruct it through probabilistic frameworks, such as
diffusion models \[4, 5, 6\], language models (LM) \[7, 8, 9\] and
masked transformer \[10, 11\] based approaches. Recently, generative
modeling has achieved remarkable success in SE, producing high-quality
speech reconstruction and demonstrating strong robustness under low SNR
conditions. Nevertheless, the substantial computational resources
required by such models, particularly the multiple sampling steps in
diffusion/flow-matching-based methods \[12, 13\] greatly hinder their
deployment on low resource devices. Moreover, current
diffusion/flow-matching-based SE models typically condition only on
noisy mel-spectrograms or latents of the noisy waveform from variational
autoencoders (VAE) \[14\], which provide irregular and noisy
representations, thereby leading to suboptimal naturalness and
intelligibility in the generated outputs.

To mitigate the inefficiency of multi-step sampling, recent studies have
explored one-step generative frameworks \[12, 15, 16\]. Among them,
MeanFlow \[17\] introduces a principled formulation that leverages the
average velocity, defined as the displacement over a time interval,
instead of the instantaneous velocity in standard flow-matching. This
reformulation links average and instantaneous velocities, offering a
stable and efficient training target for one-step generation. Though
still trailing multi-step models, MeanFlow demonstrate superior
performance than previous one-step generation frameworks. Meanwhile,
unlike fully generative tasks, SE benefits from the presence of a
reference signal, making the problem more tractable and well-suited for
one-step generative modeling.

Motivated by these insights, we propose MeanFlowSE, an efficient
one-step generative SE framework. MeanFlowSE integrates one-step
generative modeling of MeanFlow with conditioning from SSL
representations, which provide fine-grained acoustic cues and rich
semantic information to guide generation. Experiments show that
MeanFlowSE not only achieves SOTA-level performance on public and
simulated test sets but also substantially reduces computational
demands, marking a significant step toward practical deployment of
generative SE.

## 2 Proposed Method

MeanFlowSE aims to recover a clean signal $`x\in\mathbb{R}^{T}`$ from a
noisy signal $`y\in\mathbb{R}^{T}`$ by modeling their transformation in
the latent space. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the framework contains three
major components: (1) an SSL model to extract latent acoustic and
semantic representations, (2) a latent Diffusion Transformer
(DiT) \[18\]-based MeanFlow module that predicts the average velocity
field, and (3) a VAE decoder for waveform reconstruction. This modular
design allows us to integrate powerful pre-trained models while keeping
inference simple and efficient.

### 2.1 MeanFlow for Speech Enhancement

Conventional flow-matching learns an instantaneous velocity field
$`v(z_{t},t)`$ that governs the evolution of latent states through the
ordinary differential equation (ODE):

```math
\frac{dz}{dt}=v(z_{t},t),\hskip 10.00002ptz_{0}=y,\,z_{1}=x, \tag{1}
```

where $`z_{t}`$ denotes the latent representation at time step $`t`$.
During inference, solving this ODE requires multiple integration steps,
which hinders real-time deployment.

To address this, MeanFlow replaces the instantaneous velocity field with
an average velocity field:

```math
u(z_{t},r,t)=\frac{1}{t-r}\int_{r}^{t}v(z_{\tau},\tau)\,d\tau, \tag{2}
```

which summarizes the overall trend of transformation between two time
steps $`(r,t)`$. This formulation enables direct recovery of the clean
latents in one-step:

```math
z_{0}=z_{1}-u(z_{1},0,1), \tag{3}
```

where in this paper $`z_{1}`$ denotes the noisy latents and $`z_{0}`$
denotes the predicted clean latents. By learning $`u`$ instead of $`v`$,
the model bypasses iterative ODE solvers \[19\] and achieves efficient
one-step generative enhancement.

### 2.2 Network Architecture

As illustrated in Fig. 1, MeanFlowSE consists of three key modules: an
SSL encoder, a VAE encoder–decoder, and a DiT-based MeanFlow backbone.
Together, they provide semantic conditioning, establish a structured
latent domain, and enable efficient one-step generative enhancement.

#### 2.2.1 SSL Encoder

MeanFlowSE leverages a pre-trained SSL model to extract high-level
acoustic and semantic latents $`z_{y}`$ from the noisy input $`y`$.
These latents are used as conditioning signals for the generative
backbone. Compared to noisy latents from a VAE encoder, SSL latents
capture long-range dependencies and phonetic content \[20\], which are
crucial for preserving intelligibility in low-SNR conditions. During
inference, the SSL encoder acts as the sole feature extractor from noisy
speech.

#### 2.2.2 VAE Encoder–Decoder

The VAE encoder–decoder establishes the latent space in which
enhancement is performed. During training, the encoder maps the clean
waveform $`x`$ into its latent representation $`z_{x}=\text{Enc}(x)`$,
which serves as the supervision target. At inference, the decoder
transforms the predicted clean latent $`z_{0}`$ from the generative
backbone into the waveform domain, producing the enhanced waveform
$`\hat{x}=\text{Dec}(z_{0})`$.

#### 2.2.3 DiT-based MeanFlow Backbone

The DiT backbone serves as the generative core of MeanFlowSE. It takes
interpolated latents $`z_{t}`$ (constructed by combining $`z_{x}`$ with
Gaussian noise $`\epsilon`$) concatenated with noisy latents $`z_{y}`$,
further enriched with positional embedding $`PE`$. Meanwhile, time step
embeddings $`\text{TE}(r)`$ and $`\text{TE}(t)`$ are summed and injected
into the DiT blocks through adaptive layer normalization (AdaLN),
explicitly controlling the MeanFlow dynamics. The network is trained to
predict the target average velocity field $`u`$, derived analytically
from $`z_{x}`$ and $`\epsilon`$. At inference, with $`(r=0,t=1)`$, the
model directly refines Gaussian noise $`\epsilon`$ into enhanced clean
latents $`z_{0}`$ in one-step using the predicted average velocity field
$`\hat{u}`$:

```math
z_{0}=\epsilon-\hat{u}. \tag{4}
```

### 2.3 Training Objective

To optimize the MeanFlow module, we minimize the gap between predicted
and target average velocities. Instead of a plain $`\ell_{2}`$ loss, we
adopt an adaptive $`\ell_{2}`$ loss that reweights training samples
according to their error magnitude:

```math
\mathcal{L}=\mathbb{E}\!\left[w\cdot\|\hat{u}(z_{t},r,t)-u\|_{2}^{2}\right], \tag{5}
```

where $`w=(\delta^{2}+c)^{-(1-\gamma)}`$ is a weight depending on the
sample error $`\delta^{2}=\|\hat{u}-u\|_{2}^{2}`$, with hyperparameters
$`\gamma`$ and $`c`$ controlling the adaptivity. This loss down-weights
outliers (large errors) and emphasizes reliable samples, leading to more
stable training and better generalization than uniform $`\ell_{2}`$.

### 3.1 Datasets & Evaluation Metrics

Training data. All models are trained on the Interspeech 2020 DNS
Challenge dataset \[22\], including clean speech, noise, and room
impulse responses (RIRs). During training, each sample is constructed by
first randomly selecting a clean speech segment, a noise segment, and an
RIR. The clean speech is convolved with the RIR to simulate
reverberation and then mixed with noise at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
randomly sampled between $`-10`$ dB and $`20`$ dB. The resulting mixture
is cropped into a 4-second segment, and all audio signals are resampled
to 16 kHz.

Test sets. For acoustic evaluation, we adopt the Interspeech 2020 DNS
Challenge blind test set, which includes three subsets: With Reverb,
Without Reverb, and Real Recording. This allows us to assess performance
under both controlled and real-world acoustic conditions. We also
generate a simulated test set using the same procedure as in training.

Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate systems along three complementary axes:
(1) Acoustic quality using DNSMOS \[23\]; (2) Semantic Preservation
using word error rate (WER) computed by OpenAI’s Whisper-Large ASR
model \[24\]¹¹ 1
[https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v3);
(3) Efficiency using RTF measured on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.

These metrics collectively reflect listening quality, recognition
robustness, and computational efficiency, providing a balanced
assessment of SE models. For each case, we perform 5 independent
sampling runs and report the best result.

### 3.2 Implementation Details

Model configuration. We employ WavLM-Large \[25\]²² 2
[https://huggingface.co/microsoft/wavlm-large](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/wavlm-large) as
the SSL Encoder. Features from all 24 transformer layers are fused
through a trainable weighted sum with softmax normalization to form the
noisy condition. For clean speech, we use the WaveVAE from KALL-E \[26,
27\] as the VAE encoder–decoder, pre-trained on 16 kHz waveforms,
producing 256-dimensional latent representations at 25 Hz.

The DiT serves as the backbone of MeanFlowSE, consisting of $`N=8`$
transformer layers, each with 8 attention heads, hidden size 512, and
feed-forward dimension 2048. MeanFlow is configured
following \[17\] with a flow ratio of 0.25. The two time steps $`(r,t)`$
are sampled from a log-normal distribution $`(\mu=-0.4,\sigma=1.0)`$.
The model is trained to predict the average velocity field via
autograd-based JVP formulation, with adaptive weighting parameters
$`\gamma=0.5`$ and $`c=10^{-3}`$. Time embeddings use sinusoidal
frequency encoding followed by a linear layer, and positional encoding
employs standard 1D sinusoidal embeddings.

Training configuration. All models are trained for 200 epochs using the
AdamW optimizer, with an initial learning rate of $`1\times 10^{-3}`$
exponentially decayed by 0.99 per epoch. Gradient clipping with a
maximum norm of 1.0 is applied. Training is conducted on 8 NVIDIA RTX
4090 GPUs.

Baseline Systems. We compare MeanFlowSE with SOTA SE models, including
discriminative models \[3, 2\], flow-matching-based models \[14\],
language-model-based approaches \[7, 21\], and masked transformer
model \[11\]. To evaluate design choices, we include two MeanFlowSE
variants: (1) replacing SSL-based latents with noisy VAE latents, and
(2) setting the flow ratio to zero ($`r=t`$), which reduces the MeanFlow
objective to standard flow-matching.

### 3.3 Results

Table 1 reports the DNSMOS scores of all systems on the Interspeech 2020
DNS Challenge blind test set across three scenarios: With Reverb,
Without Reverb, and Real Recording. Generative models consistently
achieve higher perceptual scores than discriminative models,
highlighting their advantage in enhancing speech naturalness and
listening quality. Among them, the proposed MeanFlowSE attains SOTA or
comparable results across all DNSMOS metrics.

Table 2 further compares WER, RTF, and model size. MeanFlowSE achieves
the lowest WER among generative baselines, indicating superior
preservation of linguistic content. It also delivers the lowest RTF at
0.013, surpassing even some discriminative models in latency. In terms
of parameter efficiency, MeanFlowSE contains only 40.7 M trainable
parameters, the smallest among the evaluated generative models. This
compact design, together with strong DNSMOS performance and low-latency
inference, demonstrates the high efficiency of MeanFlow for one-step
generative modeling in SE and highlights MeanFlowSE’s potential for
real-time speech communication applications.

### 3.4 Ablation Study

We conduct ablation studies to examine the effects of the two key design
choices in MeanFlowSE.

SSL conditioning v.s. VAE conditioning. Replacing SSL-based latents with
noisy VAE representations leads to noticeable degradation in both DNSMOS
and WER. This suggests that VAE latents, being noisier and less
structured, provide weaker guidance, whereas SSL embeddings capture
richer contextual and phonetic information, improving perceptual quality
and semantic preservation. These results highlight the importance of
leveraging high-quality SSL features for robust speech enhancement.

MeanFlow v.s. standard flow-matching. Substituting MeanFlow with
standard flow-matching using 40 or 100 inference steps shows that the
40-step variant performs comparably in DNSMOS but with higher RTF, while
100 steps slightly improve DNSMOS at the cost of even greater latency.
This confirms that MeanFlow achieves an effective trade-off between
enhancement quality and inference efficiency.

## 4 Conclusions

In this paper, we propose MeanFlowSE, a one-step generative speech
enhancement model built on MeanFlow and a condition of SSL embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that it achieves SOTA-level acoustic
and semantic preservation while maintaining compact model size,
low-latency inference, and strong robustness under diverse acoustic
conditions, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.
Future work will focus on further improving speech quality, adapting the
model for low-latency streaming processing, and extending the framework
to full-band scenarios.
