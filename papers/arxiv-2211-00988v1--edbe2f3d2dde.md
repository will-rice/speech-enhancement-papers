###### Abstract

Deep latent variable generative models based on variational autoencoder
(VAE) have shown promising performance for audio-visual speech
enhancement (AVSE). The underlying idea is to learn a VAE-based
audio-visual prior distribution for clean speech data, and then combine
it with a statistical noise model to recover a speech signal from a
noisy audio recording and video (lip images) of the target speaker.
Existing generative models developed for AVSE do not take into account
the sequential nature of speech data, which prevents them from fully
incorporating the power of visual data. In this paper, we present an
audio-visual deep Kalman filter (AV-DKF) generative model which assumes
a first-order Markov chain model for the latent variables and
effectively fuses audio-visual data. Moreover, we develop an efficient
inference methodology to estimate speech signals at test time. We
conduct a set of experiments to compare different variants of generative
models for speech enhancement. The results demonstrate the superiority
of the AV-DKF model compared with both its audio-only version and the
non-sequential audio-only and audio-visual VAE-based models.

## 1 Introduction

AVSE (AVSE) is the task of estimating a clean speech signal given a
noisy audio recording, as well as visual information (e.g., lip images)
of the speaker \[[1](#bib.bib1)\]. Visual data provide complementary
information that could be very helpful for speech enhancement,
especially when the audio recording is highly noisy \[[1](#bib.bib1),
[2](#bib.bib2)\]. Furthermore, visual data are robust with respect to
acoustic noise and could help discriminate between the target speaker
and potential concurrent speakers. Over the last decade and with the
unprecedented progress made in deep learning, the AVSE problem has been
extensively revisited \[[3](#bib.bib3), [4](#bib.bib4), [5](#bib.bib5),
[1](#bib.bib1)\].

A dominant AVSE approach is to design and train a deep neural
architecture that fuses audio and visual features, extracted from video
and noisy audio data, respectively, to estimate the clean speech signal
directly. This approach is data-driven and, as such, its success and
generalization performance depend heavily on the amount of training data
and their diversity, e.g., in terms of noise types. In contrast to this
supervised AVSE framework, a recent alternative paradigm is to combine
the classical model-based methods, e.g., maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimation, with the expressive power of DNNs (DNNs) to perform
unsupervised AVSE \[[6](#bib.bib6), [7](#bib.bib7), [8](#bib.bib8),
[9](#bib.bib9)\]. More precisely, in a pre-training phase, the
statistical characteristics of speech signals in the time-frequency
domain are learned via a deep generative model based on variational
autoencoders (VAEs) \[[10](#bib.bib10)\], with only clean AV (AV) data.
The learned speech generative model, serving as a deep speech prior, is
then combined with a parametric statistical model for noise, whose
parameters along with the clean speech signal are estimated following an
EM (EM)-based approach. As noise is modeled at test time, unsupervised
AVSE can adapt to unseen noise situations and has a potentially better
generalization performance than its supervised counterpart
\[[6](#bib.bib6)\].

The AV-VAE models developed so far for unsupervised AVSE do not account
for the sequential nature of speech data, as they rely on a statistical
independence assumption between consecutive speech time frames, and thus
ignore their intrinsic correlations. Recently, some dynamical variants
of VAEs, called DVAEs \[[11](#bib.bib11)\], have been used for
audio-only speech enhancement \[[12](#bib.bib12)\], which effectively
model the temporal dynamics of speech data and improve the enhancement
performance with respect to VAEs. Nevertheless, this comes at the cost
of complicating the EM step at test time, due to the complex temporal
dependencies of latent variables in the models.

In this paper, we extend the unsupervised AVSE framework to audio-visual
DVAE models, with a focus on respecting the computational efficiency of
original non-sequential models for speech enhancement. To this end, we
develop an audio-visual extension of the deep Kalman filter (DKF) model
\[[13](#bib.bib13)\], as the simplest DVAE variant in terms of temporal
dependencies and architecture, which assumes a first-order Markov model
on the latent variables. The proposed AV-DKF model efficiently
incorporates visual data for clean speech generative modeling.
Furthermore, we propose a dedicated EM-based methodology for parameter
learning and speech estimation at test time. Our experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of the developed AV-DKF framework for speech
enhancement compared with both its audio-only variant considered by Bie
et al. \[[12](#bib.bib12)\], and the standard AV-VAE model proposed in
\[[6](#bib.bib6)\].

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

## 2 Background

Let us denote the STFT (STFT) representations of clean speech signals as
$`\mathbf{s}_{{1:T}}=\{\mathbf{s}_{t}\}_{t=1}^{T}`$, where
$`{\mathbf{s}_{t}=[s_{ft}]_{f=1}^{F}\in\mathbb{C}^{F}}`$. A latent
variable $`\mathbf{z}_{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{L}`$ ($`{L\ll F}`$) is
associated to each STFT time frame $`\mathbf{s}_{t}`$. The VAE framework
then involves modeling the joint distribution of the observed and latent
variables with some parametric Gaussian forms. The standard VAE model
assumes the following factorization
$`p_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_{{1:T}},\mathbf{z}_{{1:T}})=\prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_{t},\mathbf{z}_{t})=\prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t})p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t})`$.
This modeling framework has been extended to the audio-visual case by
conditioning the two distributions on visual features
\[[6](#bib.bib6)\]. No temporal modeling is considered here, which is
not realistic for speech STFT time frames. To resolve this issue, DVAEs
consider the following factorization:
$`p_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_{{1:T}},\mathbf{z}_{{1:T}})=\prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_{t}|\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1},\mathbf{z}_{1:t})p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t}|\mathbf{s}_{1:t-1},\mathbf{z}_{1:t-1})`$.
The two distributions involved in this factorization are parameterized
by some DNN (DNN) architectures, known as the decoder and prior
networks, respectively.

Parameter inference, i.e., learning $`\theta`$, necessitates computation
of the posterior distribution
$`p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{{1:T}}|\mathbf{s}_{{1:T}})`$, which is highly
intractable due to the non-linear generative model. As a solution, a
variational approximation is employed where a Gaussian form
parameterized by a DNN, called the encoder, is introduced to approximate
the intractable posterior \[[10](#bib.bib10)\]. For DVAEs, this writes
$`q_{\psi}(\mathbf{z}_{{1:T}}|\mathbf{s}_{{1:T}})=\prod_{t=1}^{T}q_{\psi}(\mathbf{z}_{t}|\mathbf{s}_{1:T},\mathbf{z}_{1:t-1})`$.
The inference phase involves joint learning of the model parameters by
optimizing the so-called evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the intractable
data log-likelihood $`\log p_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_{1:T})`$ with
stochastic gradient-based algorithms \[[10](#bib.bib10),
[12](#bib.bib12)\]. Depending on how the observed and latent variables
are structured in the decoder and prior, several variants of the DVAE
arise. In particular, DKF, as the simplest DVAE variant, assumes the
following joint factorization
$`p_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_{{1:T}},\mathbf{z}_{{1:T}})=\prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t})p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t-1})`$,
i.e., with a first-order Markov model on the latent variables.

The speech enhancement phase consists in combining the pre-trained
speech generative model (the learned speech prior) with a parametric
Gaussian model for noise, usually based on a NMF (NMF) variance model
\[[14](#bib.bib14)\]. The NMF parameters are then learned from the
observed noisy STFT time frames, followed by speech signal estimation
based on Wiener filtering. Here, one would also need to compute the
posterior distribution of latent variables, which is intractable. A
variational EM approach is proposed in \[[12](#bib.bib12)\] that
fine-tunes the pre-trained clean encoder on the noisy observations to
approximate the intractable posterior.

## 3 Proposed framework

### 3.1 Audio-visual DKF Generative model

We follow the DKF generative model \[[11](#bib.bib11)\], and propose to
extend it to the audio-visual case. Given some clean AV training data
$`\mathbf{u}_{1:T}=\left\{\mathbf{s}_{t},\mathbf{v}_{t}\right\}_{t=1}^{T}`$,
with $`\mathbf{v}_{t}`$ being the visual feature vector at time frame
$`t`$ extracted using a video encoder, the generative model is defined
as follows:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
|     |

````math
\begin{cases}p_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{v}_{t})=\mathcal{N}_{c}\Big(\boldsymbol{0},\mbox{{diag}}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\theta_{s}}^{2}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{v}_{t}))\Big),\\
p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t-1},\mathbf{v}_{t})=\mathcal{N}\Big(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\theta_{z}}(\mathbf{z}_{t-1},\mathbf{v}_{t}),\mbox{{diag}}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\theta_{z}}^{2}(\mathbf{z}_{t-1},\mathbf{v}_{t}))\Big),\end{cases}
``` |  |

where $`\mathcal{N}_{c}(\boldsymbol{0},\boldsymbol{\Sigma})`$ denotes a
circularly symmetric complex Gaussian distribution,
$`\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\theta_{s}}`$, $`\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\theta_{z}}`$,
$`\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\theta_{z}}^{2}`$ are parametric non-linear
functions realized by some DNN architectures, and
$`\theta=\{\theta_{s},\theta_{z}\}`$. The approximate posterior takes
the following form:

|  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
|  | $`\displaystyle q_{\psi}(\mathbf{z}_{1:T}|\mathbf{u}_{1:T})=`$ | $`\displaystyle\prod_{t=1}^{T}q_{\psi}(\mathbf{z}_{t}|\mathbf{r}_{t})`$ |  |  |
|  | $`\displaystyle=`$ | $`\displaystyle\prod_{t=1}^{T}\mathcal{N}\Big(\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\psi}(\mathbf{r}_{t}),\mbox{{diag}}(\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\psi}^{2}(\mathbf{r}_{t}))\Big)`$ |  | (1) |

where
$`\mathbf{r}_{t}=\left\{\mathbf{z}_{t-1},\mathbf{u}_{t:T}\right\}`$
collects all the conditioning variables, and
$`\boldsymbol{\mu}_{\psi}`$, $`\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\psi}^{2}`$ are
DNN-parameterized non-linear functions, i.e., the encoder. As with the
previous works, the encoder takes the modulus square of STFT data as
input. Learning the set of parameters, i.e.,
$`\Phi=\left\{\theta,\psi\right\}`$, amounts to optimizing the ELBO:

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  |
``` math
\mathcal{L}(\Phi;\mathbf{u}_{{1:T}})=\sum_{t=1}^{T}\mathbb{E}_{q_{\psi}(\mathbf{z}_{t}|\mathbf{u}_{1:T})}\left\{\log p_{\theta}(\mathbf{s}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{v}_{t})\right\}-\\
\sum_{t=1}^{T}\mathbb{E}_{q_{\psi}(\mathbf{z}_{t-1}|\mathbf{u}_{1:T})}\left\{\mathcal{D}_{\textsc{kl}}(q_{\psi}(\mathbf{z}_{t}|\mathbf{r}_{t})\|p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t-1},\mathbf{v}_{t}))\right\},
``` |  | (2) |

where $`\mathcal{D}_{\textsc{kl}}(q\|p)`$ denotes the Kullback–Leibler
(KL) divergence between $`q`$ and $`p`$. The two expectations can be
computed recursively, as detailed in \[[11](#bib.bib11)\]. A
single-sample Monte-Carlo approximation of the two expectations is
computed followed by the *reparametrization trick* \[[10](#bib.bib10)\]
before optimizing the parameters. The proposed AV-DKF architecture is
shown in
Fig. [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model").

### 3.2 Speech Enhancement

The observed noisy speech data are modeled as
$`\mathbf{x}_{t}=\sqrt{g_{t}}\mathbf{s}_{t}+\mathbf{b}_{t}`$,
$`t=1,\ldots,\tilde{T}`$, where $`\mathbf{b}_{t}`$ corresponds to noise.
The parameters
$`\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}}=\left\{{g_{t}}\right\}_{t=1}^{\tilde{T}}`$
are non-negative scalars to take into account the potentially different
loudness between training and test speech data \[[15](#bib.bib15)\]. As
the statistical model of $`\mathbf{s}_{t}`$, i.e., the prior
distribution, the pre-trained AV-DKF generative model in
([3.1](#S3.Ex1 "3.1 Audio-visual DKF Generative model ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model"))
is used. Following the NMF approach, two matrices $`{\bf W},{\bf H}`$ of
dimensions $`F\times K`$ and $`K\times\tilde{T}`$, respectively, with
non-negative entries are considered for the variance of $`{\bf b}_{t}`$
as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  |
``` math
{\bf b}_{t}\sim\mathcal{N}_{c}(\boldsymbol{0},\text{diag}({\bf W}\boldsymbol{h}_{t})),
``` |  | (3) |

where $`\boldsymbol{h}_{t}`$ is the $`t`$-th column of $`{\bf H}`$. As
opposed to the previous works \[[15](#bib.bib15), [12](#bib.bib12)\]
that treat $`\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}}`$ as model parameters and estimate
them using multiplicative update rules, here we propose a probabilistic
modeling framework by assuming a gamma prior distribution for each
$`g_{t}`$ as follows:

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  |
``` math
p(g_{t})=\frac{\beta^{\alpha}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}g_{t}^{\alpha-1}\exp(-\beta g_{t}),
``` |  | (4) |

where $`\Gamma(.)`$ is the gamma function, and $`\alpha,\beta>0`$ (set
to some predefined values), are the shape and scale parameters,
respectively. As will be shown in
Section [4](#S4 "4 Experiments ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model"),
this new approach results in significantly more stable and improved
performance, especially for DKF-based models. Given the observed data
$`\mathbf{o}_{1:\tilde{T}}=\left\{\mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{v}_{t}\right\}_{t=1}^{\tilde{T}}`$,
we follow an EM approach to estimate the set of model parameters
$`\phi=\left\{{\bf W},{\bf H}\right\}`$, which involves optimizing the
expectation of the complete data log-likelihood with respect to the
following posterior:

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  |
``` math
p_{\phi}(\mathbf{z}_{1:{\tilde{T}}},\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}}|\mathbf{o}_{1:\tilde{T}})\propto\\
p_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}_{1:{\tilde{T}}}|\mathbf{z}_{1:{\tilde{T}}},\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}},\mathbf{v}_{1:{\tilde{T}}})p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{1:{\tilde{T}}}|\mathbf{v}_{1:{\tilde{T}}})p(\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}}),
``` |  | (5) |

where the likelihood writes:

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  |
``` math
p_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}_{1:{\tilde{T}}}|\mathbf{z}_{1:{\tilde{T}}},\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}},\mathbf{v}_{1:{\tilde{T}}})=\prod_{t=1}^{\tilde{T}}p_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t},{g}_{t},\mathbf{v}_{t})\\
=\prod_{t=1}^{\tilde{T}}\mathcal{N}_{c}\Big(\boldsymbol{0},\mbox{{diag}}(g_{t}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\theta_{s}}^{2}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{v}_{t})+{\bf W}\boldsymbol{h}_{t})\Big).
``` |  | (6) |

Unfortunately, there is no closed form expression for
([5](#S3.E5 "In 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model")).
However, as an efficient approximate approach inspired by
\[[16](#bib.bib16), [17](#bib.bib17)\], we try to find the mode of the
posterior distribution of
$`\mathbf{z}_{1:{\tilde{T}}},\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}}`$:

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  |
``` math
\mathbf{z}_{1:\tilde{T}}^{*},\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}}^{*}=\operatornamewithlimits{argmax}_{\mathbf{z}_{1:T},\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}}}~\sum_{t=1}^{\tilde{T}}\log p_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t},{g}_{t},\mathbf{v}_{t})+\\
\log p_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t-1},\mathbf{v}_{t})+\log p(g_{t}),
``` |  | (7) |

which, after substituting from
([3.1](#S3.Ex1 "3.1 Audio-visual DKF Generative model ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model")),
([4](#S3.E4 "In 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model")),
and
([6](#S3.E6 "In 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model")),
can be optimized by a few iterations of a gradient-based solver, e.g.,
Adam \[[18](#bib.bib18)\]. In the maximization (M) step, the NMF
parameters are updated according to the following approximate problem:

|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  |
``` math
{\bf W},{\bf H}\leftarrow\operatornamewithlimits{argmax}_{{\bf W},{\bf H}}~\sum_{t=1}^{\tilde{T}}\log p_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{t}^{*},{g}_{t}^{*},\mathbf{v}_{t}),
``` |  | (8) |

which can be solved with multiplicative update rules as similarly done
in \[[15](#bib.bib15)\]. The overall inference algorithm iterates
between
([7](#S3.E7 "In 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model"))
and
([8](#S3.E8 "In 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model")).
Once $`\phi^{*}=\left\{{\bf W}^{*},{\bf H}^{*}\right\}`$ is learned, the
speech signal is estimated as the posterior mean (element-wise
division):

|  |  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
|  | $`\displaystyle\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{1:\tilde{T}}`$ | $`\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}_{p_{\phi^{*}}(\mathbf{s}_{1:\tilde{T}}|\mathbf{o}_{1:\tilde{T}})}\left\{\mathbf{s}_{1:\tilde{T}}\right\}`$ |  |  |
|  |  | $`\displaystyle=\mathbb{E}_{p_{\phi^{*}}(\mathbf{z}_{1:\tilde{T}}^{*},\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}}^{*}|\mathbf{o}_{1:\tilde{T}})}\left\{\mathbb{E}_{p_{\phi^{*}}(\mathbf{s}_{1:\tilde{T}}|\mathbf{z}_{1:\tilde{T}}^{*},\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}}^{*},\mathbf{o}_{1:\tilde{T}})}\left\{\mathbf{s}_{1:\tilde{T}}\right\}\right\}`$ |  |  |
|  |  | $`\displaystyle\approx\left\{\frac{g_{t}^{*}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\theta}^{2}(\mathbf{z}_{t}^{*},\mathbf{v}_{t})}{g_{t}^{*}\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{\theta}^{2}(\mathbf{z}_{t}^{*},\mathbf{v}_{t})+{\bf W}^{*}\boldsymbol{h}_{t}^{*}}\odot\mathbf{x}_{t}\right\}_{t=1}^{\tilde{T}}.`$ |  | (9) |

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we provide a performance evaluation of our proposed
AV-DKF speech enhancement framework against some baseline methods,
including A-VAE \[[15](#bib.bib15)\], AV-VAE \[[6](#bib.bib6)\], and
A-DKF \[[12](#bib.bib12)\]. To measure the quality of the enhanced
speech signals, we use standard metrics, including the scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) in dB \[[19](#bib.bib19)\], the
short-term objective intelligibility (STOI)
measure \[[20](#bib.bib20)\], ranging in $`[0,1]`$, and the perceptual
evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) score \[[21](#bib.bib21)\], ranging
in $`[-0.5,4.5]`$. For all the metrics, the higher, the better.

Datasets. For training all the VAE variants, we used the TCD-TIMIT
corpus \[[22](#bib.bib22)\]. This dataset contains AV speech data from
56 English speakers (39 for training, 8 for validation, and 9 for
testing) with an Irish accent, uttering 98 different sentences, each
$`\sim`$ 5-second long, and sampled at 16 kHz. This amounts to $`\sim`$
8 hours of data. There is a corresponding video file for each utterance
that captures a frontal view of the speaker at a rate of 30 frames per
second. For all the videos, the lip ROI (ROI) are already extracted as
$`67\times 67`$ images (a sample is shown in
Fig. [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model")).
The STFT of the speech data is computed with a 1024 samples-long (64 ms)
sine window, 75$`\%`$ overlap, without zero-padding, yielding STFT
frames of length $`F=513`$. The ROI images for each video were upsampled
across time to make visual and audio frame rates equal. Moreover, we
augmented each video into 75 different samples by applying natural image
transformations such as random translation up to 10%, random scaling and
crop up to 10%, and random brightness and contrast jitter up to 40%.

To test the speech enhancement performance, we used the noisy speech
material of the NTCD-TIMIT corpus \[[23](#bib.bib23)\] which has been
created by adding six noise types, including LR (LR), White, Cafe, Car,
Babble, and Street, with different signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios to the
test speech data of the TCD-TIMIT corpus. We randomly selected 5
utterances per noise level and noise type from each test speaker, which
resulted in 1350 test utterances.

Models architectures. The A-VAE and AV-VAE models share the same
architectures as the baseline VAE model experimented in
\[[17](#bib.bib17), [12](#bib.bib12)\], where the encoder and decoder
comprise a single fully connected (FC) hidden layer with 128 nodes and
tanh activation functions. For the DKF models, we followed a similar
architecture as the one proposed in \[[12](#bib.bib12)\], which consists
of a backward long short-term memory (LSTM) network, a combiner function
in the encoder, and a gated transition function in the prior network
\[[13](#bib.bib13)\]. The decoder comprises a multilayer perception
(MLP) with four hidden layers of dimensions 32, 64, 128, and 256, with
the tanh activation functions. We took the pre-trained A-VAE and A-DKF
models of \[[12](#bib.bib12)\], trained on the (audio-only) Wall Street
Journal (WSJ0) corpus \[[24](#bib.bib24)\], and fine-tuned them on our
training data.¹¹ 1
[https://github.com/XiaoyuBIE1994/DVAE_SE](https://github.com/XiaoyuBIE1994/DVAE_SE)
Similarly, we fine-tuned AV-VAE and AV-DKF from their audio-only
pre-trained counterparts \[[12](#bib.bib12)\].

For the AV models, the raw visual data are processed by a feature
extraction network, called VE (video encoder) in
Fig. [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model"),
before feeding to the model. For that, we incorporated a pre-trained
model that is part of the lipreading network proposed in
\[[25](#bib.bib25)\]. We took the initial blocks of the visual network,
which include a 3D convolutional module and a ResNet architecture
module. We used the computed features as the visual input of our model,
without fine-tuning the VE network during the training process. The
introduced “skip connection” in
Fig. [1](#S1.F1 "Figure 1 ‣ 1 Introduction ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model")
helps stabilize the contribution of visual information, since parts of
the model are fine-tuned from A-DKF.

Parameters settings. For all the models, the latent dimension is set to
$`L=16`$. Moreover, the NMF parameters are initialized with non-negative
random entries (the same values for all the methods), with $`K=8`$. For
the DKF models, we used a sequence length of $`T=50`$, as in
\[[12](#bib.bib12)\]. Also, we set the gamma parameters in
([4](#S3.E4 "In 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model"))
to $`\alpha=\beta=1`$, and initialized $`\mathbf{g}_{1:\tilde{T}}`$ with
an all-one vector. Furthermore, $`\mathbf{z}_{1:\tilde{T}}`$ is
initialized by feeding $`\mathbf{x}_{1:\tilde{T}}`$ (and
$`\mathbf{v}_{1:\tilde{T}}`$, for AV models) to the encoder and taking
the mean of $`q_{\psi}`$. All the models are trained with the Adam
optimizer, with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a batch size of 128. We
used early stopping on the validation set with a patience of 50 epochs,
i.e., the training stops if the validation loss does not improve after
50 consecutive epochs. For all the models, the number of EM iterations
for speech enhancement was set to 100, where at each iteration, the
E-step
([7](#S3.E7 "In 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model"))
was performed using the Adam optimizer, for 20 iterations and with a
learning rate of $`0.001`$.

Results. The speech enhancement results are reported in
Table [1](#S3.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model"),
where for each competing method, we report two sets of results
corresponding to the two different approaches for updating the scaling
parameter $`g_{t}`$ in the observation model. In each cell, the top and
bottom rows correspond, respectively, to the multiplicative update rule
proposed in \[[15](#bib.bib15), [12](#bib.bib12)\] and the probabilistic
framework proposed in this work, i.e.,
([4](#S3.E4 "In 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model"))
and
([7](#S3.E7 "In 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model")).
By inspecting
Table [1](#S3.T1 "Table 1 ‣ 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model")
we can draw several conclusions. First, as can be clearly seen, the
proposed update framework for $`g_{t}`$ yields more stable and improved
performance than the multiplicative updates, especially for the DKF
models. Specifically, for the non-sequential VAEs, i.e., A-VAE and
AV-VAE, the PESQ and STOI values consistently improved but for SI-SDR
there is a degradation, which is less significant for AV-VAE. The effect
of the proposed update rule is more noticeable for the DKF models,
without which, the models do not work well, especially for higher noise
levels. In fact, we noticed in our experiments that without constraining
$`g_{t}`$ with a proper regularization, e.g., the gamma prior, the
enhancement method for the DKF models would lead to improper noise
removal.
Fig [2](#S4.F2 "Figure 2 ‣ 4 Experiments ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model")
shows an illustrative example with AV-DKF, where we can see that some
speech time frames are wrongly estimated either as zero or noisy, which
could be due to too small and too large values for $`g_{t}`$,
respectively (cf. Equation
([9](#S3.Ex3 "In 3.2 Speech Enhancement ‣ 3 Proposed framework ‣ Audio-visual Speech Enhancement with a Deep Kalman Filter Generative Model"))).

We also see a clear and consistent performance improvement for the DKF
models compared with their non-sequential versions. Specifically, AV-DKF
exhibits an average performance gain of about 2.5 dB in SI-SDR, 0.18 in
PESQ, and 0.05 (5%) in STOI over AV-VAE. This signifies the importance
of temporal modeling. Comparing the results of AV-DKF and its audio-only
version, A-DKF, demonstrates average gains of about 2 dB in SI-SDR, 0.10
in PESQ, and 0.02 (2%) in STOI. This proves the usefulness of visual
information for speech enhancement. Moreover, the amount of improvement
is higher for larger amounts of noise, i.e., situations wherein the role
of visual modality is more highlighted, meaning that AV-DKF is able to
efficiently incorporate the useful information of visual data for speech
enhancement. Supplementary material, including audio-visual examples,
will be available online.²² 2

## 5 Conclusion

We presented the audio-visual deep Kalman filter (AV-DKF) model to learn
the prior distribution of clean speech data for speech enhancement. In
contrast to the non-sequential models used in the prior work, the AV-DKF
model incorporates visual data more efficiently. Besides, we developed
an inference algorithm for speech enhancement based on the learned
speech prior. Our experiments confirmed the superiority of the AV-DKF
model compared with its audio-only version and non-sequential models.
Future work includes extending the proposed framework to other dynamical
models \[[11](#bib.bib11)\].
