## Architecture

`papers_pipeline` validates configuration, fetches source records through
adapters, normalizes and deduplicates them, applies topic gates, reconciles the
inventory with the corpus, selects deterministic budgeted batches, converts
inputs, formats changed files, updates the index, and commits each consistent
stage. Source continuations retain an opaque cursor and its exact UTC fetch
window across bounded runs under one shared deadline. Conversion failures are
isolated by paper; infrastructure failures stop the run.

## Configuration

`papers.yml` defines repository identity, enabled adapters, topic gates, fetch
policy, conversion budgets, and concurrency. Run
`uv run papers-pipeline validate --config papers.yml` before a manual run.
Unknown keys, duplicate adapters, and invalid ranges are rejected.

Adapter `lookback_days` is 1-365, `page_size` is 1-1000, `max_pages` is 1-100,
and `max_results` is 1-10000. Semantic Scholar reads the API key from the
environment variable named by `secret_env`; adapters without credentials use
`secret_env: null`. The supported `filters` are:

- `arxiv`: `search_query`
- `semantic_scholar`: `query`
- `dblp`: `query`
- `biorxiv_crossref`: `provider`, set to `biorxiv` or `crossref`
- `huggingface` and `papers_with_code`: no filter keys

Topic gates support `include_any`, `include_all`, `exclude_any`, and
`categories`. Set `plugin: topic_plugin:accept_topic` only when these gates
cannot express the repository rule; the plugin accepts `Paper` and returns
`TopicDecision`.

Fetch request timeouts are 1-120 seconds, retries are 0-5, backoff is 0-30
seconds, and the shared fetch deadline is 60-7200 seconds. Conversion allows
1-20 batches per run, 1-100 papers per batch, and a total cost budget of
1-1000. Each converter may run for 60-3600 seconds before it is terminated.
Per-paper HTML and LaTeX costs are 1-100; PDF cost is 1-1000. HTML and LaTeX
concurrency is 1-4. PDF concurrency is always exactly 1.

## Run locally

```bash
uv sync --locked --extra dev
uv tool install marker-pdf==1.10.1
uv pip install --no-deps pypandoc-binary==1.15
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
ln -sf "$(uv run python -c 'import pypandoc; print(pypandoc.get_pandoc_path())')" \
  "$HOME/.local/bin/pandoc"
npm install --global prettier@3.6.2
uv run papers-pipeline validate --config papers.yml
uv run papers-pipeline nightly --config papers.yml
uv run papers-pipeline format-corpus --shard-index 0 --shard-count 8
```

All tests use checked-in fixtures and run without source APIs or converter
tools:

```bash
UV_OFFLINE=true uv run pytest
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

## State, backlog, and recovery

The nightly command derives backlog from `papers.csv` versus files under
`papers/`. `.papers-state.yml` stores each source's opaque cursor together with
the exact UTC window start/end and consecutive failure attempts. A capped run
reuses that window until enumeration completes; only the following run creates
a fresh lookback window. Legacy cursor-only state is discarded rather than
being resumed against a different window. Count and cost budgets select
deterministic batches.

A paper failure does not stop peers. A third consecutive scheduled failure
creates a colocated `.fixme.txt`; fix the input and remove the marker to retry.
Permanent per-paper download failures (including HTTP 404/410 and invalid input
URLs) count toward that paper's failure history without cancelling peers.
Authentication, rate limits, outages, network/timeouts, disk failures, missing
tools, and resource exhaustion fail the run explicitly.

## Formatting

Nightly formatting receives only changed paper files and indexes. Complete
corpus formatting runs only through the manual sharded workflow.

## Automation and summaries

The nightly workflow supports its template-owned schedule and
`workflow_dispatch`. The first manual canary run fetched and committed 30
papers, then safely stopped when a PDF conversion reached the former
900-second timeout. The retry is limited to one paper with an 1800-second
conversion timeout.

The nightly Actions summary reports per-source fetched, accepted,
deduplicated, and rejected counts; inventory, generated, pending, attempted,
succeeded, failed, and fixme counts; timings; continuation, cap, retry, and
deadline events; and fixme paths.

The weekly template workflow runs Copier against an explicit release,
validates the result, and opens a pull request. It never updates `main`
directly.

## Updating from the template

Run the weekly workflow, or wait for its schedule. It resolves an immutable
release from `will-rice/papers-template`, runs Copier, refreshes the lock,
validates configuration, runs pre-commit and the offline test suite, and opens
an update pull request for review. Resolve any `.rej` file as a failed update;
never bypass validation or push an update directly to `main`.

## Ownership boundary

Copier owns pipeline code, tests, workflows, configuration scaffolding, and
support files. `papers/`, `papers.csv`, `.papers-state.yml`, and caches remain
repository-owned across Copier updates.

## Migration gate

Adoption by an existing papers repository is a separate migration. Do not begin a migration
until this generated repository smoke test passes on the exact immutable
template release selected for migration. Rehearse fixture
adoption first; then migrate lipsync-papers, tts-papers, asr-papers, and
birdclef-papers separately. Each migration must preserve corpus and Git
history, add `papers.yml`, `.papers-state.yml`, and `.copier-answers.yml`, keep
scheduling disabled, inspect the manual workflow and continuation behavior,
and only then re-enable the schedule.
